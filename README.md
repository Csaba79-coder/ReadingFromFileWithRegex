# ReadingFromFileWithRegex
Reading from file with using special regex - returns back only a part of line from txt files! Using mock (mockito) for testing the file reading!

There is a txt file, you have to find the patterns to give back the type of mobile devices!

We are looking for Android (name includes!) and version is equal or more than 7 ... (you have to get back 7 devices!)

USE regex!
